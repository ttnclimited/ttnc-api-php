# TTNC's PHP API Client

A simple PHP library that handles connection, authentication, requests and parsing of responses to and from TTNC's API. For more information on TTNC's API visit [TTNC's main API page](https://help.ttnc.co.uk/docs/api)

A list of function requests available via the API can be found in the [documentation](https://help.ttnc.co.uk/docs/api)

## Requirements

- PHP5 or greater.
- Use of file\_get\_contents to access remote URLs.
- An account with [TTNC](http://www.ttnc.co.uk).
- A VKey (Application) created via [myTTNC](https://www.myttnc.co.uk).

## Usage

The API can be constructed as follows;
```php
...
$Api = new TTNCApi('<username>', '<password>', '<VKey>');
...
```

Requests can then be 'spooled' in the object until the *MakeRequests()* method is called. While not required, each request should be given an ID which can be used to retrieve the response later on;

```php
...
$Request = $Api->NewRequest('NoveroNumbers', 'ListNumbers', 'Request1Id');
...
```

### Basic Usage
```php
<?php
require_once('TTNCApi.php');
$Api = new TTNCApi('<username>', '<password>', '<VKey>');
$Request = $Api->NewRequest('NoveroNumbers', 'ListNumbers', 'Request1Id');
$Api->MakeRequests();
$Response = $Api->GetResponseFromId('Request1Id');
?>

```

In order to send data in a request - the *SetData()* method can  be called on the *Request* object;

```php
<?php
require_once('TTNCApi.php');
$Api = new TTNCApi('<username>', '<password>', '<VKey>');
$Request = $Api->NewRequest('NoveroNumbers', 'SetDestination', 'Request1Id');
$Request->SetData('Number', '02031511000');
$Request->SetData('Destination', '07512312312');
$Api->MakeRequests();
$Response = $Api->GetResponseFromId('Request1Id');
?>
```

### Parsing Responses

As long as each *Request* has been given an ID, after *MakeRequests()* is called, it can then be retrieved from the API object using the same ID.
```php
...
$Response = $Api->GetResponseFromId('Request1Id');
print_r($Response);
...
```

### Advanced Usage

The client deals automatically with the *Auth* requests for you, however, in order to perform some more advanced actions on the API (such as ordering numbers via the *AddToBasket* request) you may need to save the session state between script executions. In order to do this it's necessary to access the *SessionRequest* Response and retrieve the returned SessionId. This can then be stored in your own code (such as $_SESSION or $_COOKIE) for use on the next request;

```php
<?php
require_once('TTNCApi.php');
$Api = new TTNCApi('<username>', '<password>', '<VKey>');
$Request = $Api->NewRequest('Order', 'AddToBasket', 'Request1Id');
$Request->SetData('number', '02031231231');
$Request->SetData('type', 'number');
$Api->MakeRequests();
$Response = $Api->GetResponseFromId('SessionRequest');
// Store $Response['SessionId'] in your own code.
?>
```

Then on repeat requests, to retrieve the same basket you can construct the object without authentication and then parse in the SessionId to use on Requests;

```php
<?php
require_once('TTNCApi.php');
$Api = new TTNCApi();
$Api->UseSession($SessionId); // From the previous request, stored in your own code.
$Request = $Api->NewRequest('Order', 'ViewBasket', 'Request1Id');
$Api->MakeRequests();
$Response = $Api->GetResponseFromId('Request1Id');
// Response now contains a representation of your basket.
?>
```
